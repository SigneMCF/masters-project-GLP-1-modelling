# masters-project-GLP-1-modelling
modelling the analogues of glp-1 in the brain using differential equations
This project was completed under the supervision of Jesper Ferkinghof Borg and Mikael Lenz Strube.
For any errors encountered in the plotting please ensure that the pathing is accurately reflected.

It is recommended to run this project on a server due to long computational requirements.
To run this project please run the fily main.py in your environtment and change any parameters to your liking in the prompt.
The changeable parameters can also be changed in the main.py file.

example run prompt: python3 main.py  --filename test.txt  --t_max 864000  --initdecay 1


note that sensitive.ipynb and integrator test.ipynb as well as the results and sensitivity analysis folders are sheerly for plotting and illustration purposes and hold not relevance to teh utilization of the model.
